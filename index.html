          <h3>Jamie Floyd: <i> Upper West Side Classic 6</i></h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
            eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for
            anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice.
            Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

          <h3>Donna and Scott: <i> Rescued Renovation</i></h3>
          <br/>
          <p>
            "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
            great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I
            bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves
            Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"

          <h3>David Siegel: <i> Doubled the Value</i></h3><br>
          <p>
            "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is
            a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through
            his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to
            make home improvements."
